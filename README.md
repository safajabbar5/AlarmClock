# My Personal Project

An alarm clock application desgined to ensure the user wakes up under any circumstances. It lets the user enter information about what time they want to set their alarm and also pick a ringtone for their alarm. To turn off the alarm the user must solve a riddle. Possible features include different ringtone and time slots for setting up the alarm; the alarm will list the confirmed time and ringtone. When the alarm rings, a riddle will automatically shows up and the user must enter the correct answer to turn the alarm off. The user will receive different riddles for each day of the week, and these riddles will alternate every week.  (X will be the time in the 24-hour clock, Y will be list of selected times for the alarm.)

## Who will use it?
This application is suitable for anyone who needs an extra push to wake up in the morning.
## Why is this project of interest to you?
I am always late to my classes because I tend to turn off my alarm and fall back asleep. This project interests me because now I can use an alarm clock that requires me to stimulate my brain and wake up for my classes.
