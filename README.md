# My Personal Project-

An alarm clock application for waking up under any circumstances. It lets you enter information about what time you want to set your alarm and lets you pick the ringtone for the alarm, when your alarm rings then you must solve the riddle to turn off the alarm. Possible features include different ringtone and time slots for setting up the alarm; then it lists the times confirmed for the alarm and ringtone. When the alarm starts ringing then then the riddle automatically shows up, the user must enter the correct answer for the riddle to turn the alarm off.  (X will be time in the 24-hour clock, Y will be list of selected time for the alarm.)
