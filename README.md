# My Personal Project

An alarm clock application designed to ensure the user wakes up under any circumstances. It lets the user enter information about what time they want to set their alarm and also pick a ringtone for their alarm. To turn off the alarm the user must solve a riddle. Possible features include different ringtone and time slots for setting up the alarm; the alarm will list the confirmed time and ringtone. When the alarm rings, a riddle will automatically show up and the user must enter the correct answer to turn the alarm off. The user will receive different riddles for each day of the week, and these riddles will alternate every week.
